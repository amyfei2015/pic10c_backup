# pic10c_project
For final project

Week 4 Friday:
Talked with Professor and got some suggestions:
1.  show progress every week
2.  show learnings through the project

Idea:
Create a puzzle-like game: A picture will be divided into 4* 4 grids, and each grid will be interchanged randomly, and flipped so that the user only see its content when the use click uppn the picture. Every time the user can only see the content of one picture. At the same time, the use can exchange the positions of any two asjacent pictures. The aim of the game id to put all grids back to the correct place, and then the original picture will be shown.

For this design, I need to see how pictures could be accessed in c++, and hopefully I could make it a Qt project so that it involves user-interface. 



Week 7 Friday:
After walting many Qt game tutorials and former c++ projects on Youtube, I decided to create a game, where players need to collect treasures without being caught by soldiers.
